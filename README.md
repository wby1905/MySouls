# MySouls
A soul-like game built to learn C++ and Unreal.
Developed with Unreal Engine 5 and C++. All assets used are from Unreal Marketplace or created by myself. 
ONLY for learning purposes!

Only built a small level(Test) to showcase what I've created and the actual game map (MyDungeon) is not used.
## Control:
+ WASD for move
+ space bar to jump
+ Left mouse button for attack
+ Right mouse button for dodge
+ E key for equip/unequip weapon
+ tab for targeting enemy
## Features
+ Almost all developed with C++
+ Two kinds of Weapons (one-handed & two-handed)
+ Animations, motion warping, Foot IK
+ Enemy AI (not using Blackboard and Behavior tree, but created a status machine with C++ code)
